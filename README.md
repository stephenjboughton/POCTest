# Creating Angular Libraries and publishing them within github package registry

This guide: https://medium.com/@brgrz/create-a-library-with-angular-and-publish-it-to-github-package-registry-c8184193b993 is pretty good, but there are a few tricks to be aware of.

### Command line parameters
All ng command line commands that have parameters require "--" even if it only shows a single dash, for example:
```ng g library ComponentsLib -prefix cmpts```
should actually be
```ng g library ComponentsLib --prefix cmpts```

### Build successfully without Ivy
Before running ng build, add kvp to tsconfig.lib.json to avoid using Ivy:
```
"angularCompilerOptions": {
    "skipTemplateCodegen": true,
    "strictMetadataEmit": true,
    "enableResourceInlining": true,
    "enableIvy": false
  },
```

### Push the workspace as a repo before Build and ensure agreement with repository node in package.json
When adding the "repository" node to the library-level package.json file, make sure the node looks like this:
```
    "repository": {
        "type": "git",
        "url": https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY‚Äù
      }
```
And be sure the REPOSITORY name appended to the url matches the name of the repo you pushed for the workspace (not the name of the library/package itself)
This url should not start with git and end with .git as suggested int he article (in our experience)

### Build from the right directory level
In step 8 make sure you run ng build from within the projects/<library> directory, not just the workspace

### If component in library uses an html template with model binding, you need to add FormsModule to imports array within library's base .module.ts file
Otherwise ng build will throw errors like "can't bind to 'ngModel' since it isn't a known property of 'input' when trying to compile

### Use library Module, not individual components
Although we may be using components from the library within other projects we need to import the libraryModule and add it to the imports array in those projects, not just import the individual components and add them to the declarations array.  

### Unless you want to do an inline template within component.ts, you must reference html file with templateUrl, not template

### css or scss also needs to be reference as styleUrls[], not just styles[]
